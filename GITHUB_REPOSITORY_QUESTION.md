# 🔍 GitHub Repository Confusion - Need Your Input

## ❓ Question for You

Your screenshot shows a repository with **TWO backend folders:**
- `ultra-fitness-backend` ❌ (old)
- `mother-fitness-backend` ✅ (new)

But we created a separate repository for JUST the backend.

---

## 🎯 What I Need You To Do

**Go to Render Dashboard:**

1. Open your Render service
2. Click **"Settings"** 
3. Look at the **"Repository"** section
4. **Copy the EXACT GitHub URL shown there**

---

## 📋 Which URL Does It Show?

### Option A (CORRECT - backend only):
```
https://github.com/motherfitnessandrahalli-commits/mother-fitness-backend
```
✅ This repository should have ONLY backend files at root
✅ No `ultra-fitness-backend` folder inside

### Option B (WRONG - has multiple folders):
```
https://github.com/motherfitnessandrahalli-commits/[some-other-name]
```
❌ This repository has member-app, mother-fitness-backend, ultra-fitness-backend folders
❌ This is the FULL project, not just backend

---

## ✅ Next Steps (After You Tell Me)

**If Option A:** 
- Your Render config is perfect
- Just need to fix the 3 Render settings (Root Directory, Build Command, Start Command)

**If Option B:**
- We need to change Render to use the correct backend-only repository
- OR upload just the backend to a new repository

**Please tell me: What GitHub URL does Render show?**
